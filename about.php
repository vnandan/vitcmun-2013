            <h4>Model United Nations</h4><hr/>
            <p class="subheader" id="description">A Model United Nations also known as a MUN is an academic simulation of the United Nations that aims to educate participants about current events, topics in international relations, diplomacy and the United Nations agenda. The participants take on the roles of diplomats, representing a nation or an International Organization in a simulated session of an IGO (Inter - Governmental Organization). Participants research a country, investigate international issues, debate, deliberate, consult, and then develop solutions to world problems. During a conference, participants must employ a variety of communication and critical thinking skills in order to represent the policies of their country.
	    </p>
	    <p>This MUN is the first such endeavor of the Debate Society of VIT University, Chennai Campus to give the leaders of tomorrow a platform to discuss issues affecting the world today. A conference like this will make the students ponder over issues that may not be affecting them, but finding a solution to these problems may be the need of the hour in a different part of the world.</p>

<p>After the immense success of our first intra-college MUN in September 2012, we are eager to host VITC MUN'13. The councils we plan on simulating this year are - </p>
<ul class="large-offset-1 ">
<li>General Assembly (GA)</li>
<li>Indian Crisis Council</li>
<li>United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)</li>
<li>Security Council(SC)</li>
</ul>
